## Digital Storage Tutorial
## Zack Rutkowski

The following tutorial on **Digital Storage** will outline the best, most efficient methods for storing your information and how to keep your data safe over long periods of time! This is intended for people who are considering purchasing a storage device, or those who want to know the basics before transferring data onto a device.

### Capacity

Storage capacities have been increasing as file sizes of all types become larger. Ten years ago, most people only needed about 8-16 GB on their phone/laptop to store all of their files, pictures, videos, music, etc. Nowadays, it's common for people to run out of space on the phone 32-64 GB. If you're using a computer for school or work and are thinking about long term storage, I would consider getting a hard drive with between 128 GB-1 TB.

1 GB = 1000 MB   
1 TB = 1000 GB

### Cost

The cost of data storage has become extremely affordable compared to where it started. In 1956, at the dawn of data storage, it cost $10,000 per megabyte. By 1979, it was under $300 per megabyte.. a great improvement but still far from where we are today. It wasn't until 1980 that you could get a storage device that holds *one whole gigabyte*.

Here's how quickly storage cost decreased after that:

1990- $9/MB   
1995- $0.75/MB   
2000- $0.01/MB   
2005- $0.0006/MB   

By 2011 the largest storage device available for purchase was a 4 TB hard drive, and you could get it for only $400!
And now in 2022, you can get the same 4 TB hard drive for only $100.. a whopping $0.0001 per megabyte!

### Volatility

Volatile storage is memory that needs to be connected to a power source to be preserved. The most common type is RAM storage, so you should always be aware of this when saving to a local drive. But even non-volatile storage types are susceptible to losing data. Here are some common storage devices and their lifespans:

Magnetic tapes: 10 years   
Floppy disk:	10–20 years   
CDs and DVDs:	5–10 unrecorded, 2–5 recorded   
Flash storage:	5–10 years   
 
Even these common storage devices should be inspected every years to make sure the data isn't lost or corrupted. Just because it exists physically, doesn't mean it will be there forever!
